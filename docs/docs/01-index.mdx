## What is Planning Poker?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker):

> __Planning poker__, also called __Scrum poker__, is a consensus-based, gamified technique
> for estimating, mostly used for timeboxing in Agile principles. In planning poker,
> members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table,
> instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed.
> By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring,
> where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.
