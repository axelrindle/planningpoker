# Room Management

Rooms can be created, edited and deleted.

## Creation

### Open the Form

![create step 01](@site/static/screenshots/01-create-room/01.png)

> Navigate to the room list ( <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHome} /> ) and click on the <Button label="Add" icon={faPlus} /> button.

### Fill out the details

![create step 02](@site/static/screenshots/01-create-room/02.png)

Fill out the form details and click on the <Button label="Create" icon={faCheck} /> button.

Fields that have a checkbox next to it may be enabled or disabled. Disabled fields will be
considered **empty** and thus the value will be removed from the Room if valid.

:::caution
While a Room may be locked with a password, there is currently
[no way to authenticate a WebSocket connection](https://github.com/whatwg/websockets/issues/16).
A fix for this will hopefully be available in the future.

### Confirm the creation

![create step 03](@site/static/screenshots/01-create-room/03.png)

Attempting to create the new Room might fail. Error messages will be shown below the corresponding
field. A general error message (e.g. network failure) will be displayed on the bottom of the modal.

### Et v√≥ila!

![create step 04](@site/static/screenshots/01-create-room/04.png)

The new Room will appear immediately in the Room list.

## Editing

![edit context menu](@site/static/screenshots/context-room.png)

To edit a Room, right-click it and select <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPencil} /> **Edit**.

A form very similar to the one from the Room creation will appear with pre-filled fields. Make
your desired changes and click on the <Button label="Save" icon={faSave} /> button afterwards.

## Deleting

To delete a Room, right-click it and select <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faTrash} /> **Delete**.

A modal will appear requesting the confirmation to delete the selected Room.

Confirm by clicking on <Button label="Delete" icon={faTrash} />.

:::caution
A deleted Room can not be restored. In case an estimation is currently taking place,
all connected users will be kicked out of the Room.
