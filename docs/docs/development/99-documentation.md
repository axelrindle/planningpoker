# Documentation

The documentation you're currently browsing is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

While it provides the ability to build fully featured websites, the main usage of it is for
documentation generation. The raw documentation files reside within the `docs/docs` directory.

All documentation is written in Markdown.

The few React code used for the frontpage is located within the `docs/src` directory.
