# Preface

This section of the documentation aims to guide you through the development of the application itself.

It gives a short overview on the architecture of the application and provides more detailed information
about special topics like the database and file uploads.

As the whole project is somewhat based upon the usage Node.js you'll find `package.json` files everywhere.
Inspect their `scripts` section to run dev servers or compile a component.

Happy Hacking ðŸ§ª
